# Frontend Budgeting App

This is the frontend application for the Budgeting App.

## Overview

The Frontend Budgeting App is a React application that serves as the user interface for the Budgeting App. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to manage their budget by creating and tracking transactions.

## Features

Create new transactions: Users can input details such as the item name, amount, date, source, and category to create new transactions.

View, edit and delete transactions: Users can view a list of their transactions, and they have the ability to edit transaction details if needed.

Calculate and display balance: The app calculates the balance by summing the income and subtracting the expenses from the transactions. The balance is displayed prominently to provide users with an overview of their current financial state.

Routing using React Router: The app utilizes React Router to implement client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different views or pages without the need for a full page refresh.

Integration with a render site (cloud API): The frontend app is integrated with a render site (cloud API) to fetch data, such as transaction history or user-specific information, from the backend server hosted on the render site. This integration enables the app to access and display up-to-date data for users.
